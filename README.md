Here is the list of ML study and portfolio  projects that I have uploaded (in progress):

Study projects:
1. Logistic Regression with Python: https://github.com/IulliaK/Machine-Learning/blob/main/01-Logistic%20Regression%20with%20Python.ipynb
   
  Results: I used Logistic Regression to predict the class of a passenger on the Titanic - Survived or Deceased. Missing age values were imputed by using the mean age for the passenger class. I got satisfactory results which could be further improved by applying other ML models or working on a "Name" feature.
