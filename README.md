Here is the list of ML study and portfolio  projects that I have uploaded (in progress):

Portfolio:
1. Logistic Regression with Python: Logistic Regression with Python Project
   
  Results: I used Logistic Regression to predict the class of a passenger on the Titanic - Survived or Deceased. Missing age values were imputed by using the mean age for the passenger class. I got satisfactory results which could be further improved by applying other ML models or working on a "Name" feature.

Study projects:
  1. Small notebook with Logistic Regression on a fake data: [Small Logistic Regression Project.ipynb ](https://github.com/IulliaK/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Small%20Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)
     
   Results: received quite good results - confusion matrix shows that mostly all were classified correctly. I used histogram and pairplot to visualise data.
