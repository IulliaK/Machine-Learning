Here is the list of ML study and portfolio  projects that I have uploaded (in progress):

Portfolio:
1. [Logistic Regression with Python Project](https://github.com/IulliaK/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20with%20Python%20Project)
   
  Results: I used Logistic Regression to predict the class of a passenger on the Titanic - Survived or Deceased. Missing age values were imputed by using the mean age for the passenger class. I got satisfactory results which could be further improved by applying other ML models or working on a "Name" feature.

Study projects:
   1. [Small Logistic Regression Project.ipynb ](https://github.com/IulliaK/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Small%20Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb) on a fake data
     
   Results: received quite good results - confusion matrix shows that mostly all were classified correctly. I used histogram and pairplot to visualise data.

   2. [Decision Trees and Random Forests in Python.ipynb](https://github.com/IulliaK/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forests%20in%20Python.ipynb)

Result: in this notebook, we worked with a small kythosis dataset to compare the application of a single decision tree and a random forest. Because the data is highly imbalanced (most observations note the absence of the disease after the operation), the difference isn't striking but still we proved that Random Forect performs better (5 missclassified observations instead of 8 for a Decision Tree).
